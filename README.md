This depository contains code and resources associated with the 2024 Idaho Chapter of The Wildlife Society R Workshop, Mar. 26 2024. 

RStudio is a powerful open-source statistical computing software that can enhance the lives of wildlife
students and professionals. However, new users are often intimidated by the learning curve associated
with studying a programming language and novices tend to lose interest if they do not benefit from their new skills. This introduction to R is designed by Data Carpentry for participants with no programming experience and assumes no prior knowledge of R or RStudio. The first half of the workshop will begin with the basics of R syntax, the RStudio interface, and then introduce importing files and explore your data. 
The second half will introduce you how to manipulate data, create summary statistics, and plot and visualize your data.

To ask any follow-up questions related to the workshop or general help in R, post in the [Issues](https://github.com/birderboone/Intro_to_R-ICTWS-2024/issues) tab.
